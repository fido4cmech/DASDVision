
              DASD Vision for Windows Installation


  For WinXP or Win 7 Users :

  1.  Copy DVWIN.EXE to a Path directory (\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32 is ok)

  2.  Edit .Bat files for your favorite Editor (DVWEdit.BAT), your favorite
       viewer (DVWView.BAT). and your fav Help file (DVWHelp.BAT).
       ( Also see DVWUserZ.Bat for the custom option Alt+Z, and see
         DVWPlus.Bat for custom option + )

      To use defaults (LTFViewr for viewer and EditPadLite for Editor),
      Download and Install software as noted in each .Bat file.

  3.  Copy edited *.bat files to same directory as step #1

      While testing your setup, Alt+P will attempt to call EditPadLite7 and
      Alt+L will call the Large Text File Viewer, from the defined PATH. 
      (***Note: These keys can also be used during normal ops to override
       the installed .Bat files if needed)

  4.  Unzip archive DVNOTES.ZIP into C:\DOS\DV3\ path if extra Notes
       files are desired (access with Alt+A|E|K|R|W).

  5. Create Desktop shortcuts to start DVWin.Exe ***with Administrator
      priviledges*** otherwise the program will just display "Access denied".

  6.  Click the DVWin Icon to start.  If a RAMDisk is available use
      the optional format "DVWin.Exe d:" where d: = RAMDisk drive.
      If your fastest drive is NOT C:, also use same syntax where d: =
      your fastest drive of choice. (used for temp work files only)


  For Win 10 users :

  1.  Install/Unzip everything into the C:\DVWin folder including
      DVWin22.Zip, EditPad Lite Editor (if used) and LTF viewer.

  2.  Perform steps #2, #4 and #5 above ...

  3.  Modify your PATH environment variable and add "C:\DVWin;"
      (no quotes) to the beginning of same.

  4.  See step #6 above to start DASD Vision ...  


  For ALL users:

  Note: optional program arguments to set screen size: C=ccc R=rr 
           in any combination. Max: 240x100, Min/default: 132x60
           (i.e. "DVWin.Exe R: C=160" sets drive R: as work, 160x60)

  Note: if DVWUserZ.Bat is changed, the argument Z=x-x can be
           used to change the legend (x-x up to 13 chars, NO spaces)           

  Note: see Legend at bottom of screen for program Key options

  Note: the latest version of DVWin is always available on my home
